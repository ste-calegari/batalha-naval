My first programm - Naval Battle Game

This was my frist programm, i've done it with a friend on my first semester at college.
The goal of this programm is to be like the naval battle game.

The game begins asking the players which size of board they want.
The players can position their boats.
Then the naval battle begins, which player can choose a position on the board to shoot, and the game prints if they made it.
After one of the players shoot every parts of the other player's boats the game ends and shows who won and how many shoots were necessary.
